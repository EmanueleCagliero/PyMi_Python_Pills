    "So, basically, Keobox agree with Ema: a Decorator is just _syntactic sugar_ for having a compact and more readable way to do function wrapping. But added another comment, if a Decorator is just a _syntax_, the enabling \"technology\" that makes this wrapping magic happen, comes from functional programming. In fact, this is possible because in Python the functions are first class objects, and the wrapping is obtained using High Order Functions. `elapsed` is just an High Order function that takes as input a function and returs another function: the wrapper. The wrapper, just add some functionality, in this case measures the execution time _around_ a call of the original function passed as argument."
